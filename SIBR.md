## Program on Innovation Open Topics 

Section 7 of the SBIR and STTR Reauthorization Act of 2022 requires the DoD to establish `innovation open topics` activities in order to

1. Increase the transition of commercial technology to the DoD; 
2. Expand the small business nontraditional industrial base; 
3. Increase commercialization derived from investments of the DoD; and  
4. Expand the ability for qualifying small business concerns to propose technology solutions to meet the needs of the DoD. 

Unlike conventional topics, which specify the desired technical objective and output, open topics can use generalized mission requirements or AFX23.7--3 specific technology areas to adapt commercial products or solutions to close capability gaps, improve performance, or provide technological advancements in existing capabilities. A small business concern may only submit one (1) proposal to each open topic. 

If more than one proposal from a small business concern is received for a single open topic, only the most recent proposal to be certified and submitted prior to the submission deadline will receive an evaluation. 

All prior proposals submitted by the small business concern for the same open topic will be marked as noncompliant.
