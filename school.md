# school for mathematics and robotics
> math has been miscatorgorized
> math is about beauty and life and art
> math is a sense like hearing and touch
> math can aid in clear communication

## Why
1. Math is a way to sense the world just like smell or touch.
  - rythm in music
    - music is the feeling of counting without knowing it
  - shapes in nature
    - tree
    - river
    - lightning
    - our bodies blood vessels
  - artists are pattern makers and finders
  - a sense for all patterns!
2. Math is an immunization against being fooled.
3. Math is a way to create new things.
4. Math lets you hack the system.
5. Math is a way to make friends.

## narrative
Teaching mathematics globally is crucial, particularly for its creative benefits. Hereâ€™s a condensed version focusing on the creative aspects:

Fostering Innovation: Mathematics is key to technological and scientific advancements. It nurtures innovation, essential in an ever-evolving technological landscape.

Enhancing Problem-Solving: It develops problem-solving skills, encouraging creative approaches to both everyday situations and complex professional tasks.

Supporting Other Disciplines: Mathematics enriches other fields like physics, economics, and art, offering new perspectives and creative methodologies.

Cultural Appreciation: Understanding the history and principles of mathematics deepens appreciation for human intellectual achievements and cultural developments.

Future Preparedness: In a world increasingly driven by data and AI, mathematical literacy equips individuals to engage creatively with future technologies.

In essence, mathematics is not just about numbers and equations; it's a powerful tool for creative thinking, innovation, and understanding the world in novel ways.

# Tech School for Field Robotics and Manufacturing

Hello Dr. Hancock and hope all is well, 

My name is Tim Cash, David Saint-Amand helped me out and passed along your contact information after mentioning building Technical Schools focused on Robotics. I would be greatful for any direction, support or points of contact you can provide. 

# Purpose: Build a Tech School

I am looking for fabrication and lab space for 25 students focused on Robotics and Manufacturing. The classes provide foundational skills in Mathematics and Machine Learning along the way while staying hands on. Each 90 day cohort is 25 students generating $300,000 in revenue and $150,000 in expenses.

# Background 

A new technology landscape has opened due to recent advances in Machine Learning, Geospatial Data and Robotics. There is nearly unlimited demand for skilled teams that can execute on R&D prototypes in what I call "Field Robotics". 

Unfortunately, rural communities have become consumers of technology and not producers through manufacturing centralization and brain-drain into larger cities where incomes are much higher. 

My hypothesis is that small motivated teams with access to scientific and engineering centers like China Lake can capture significant ($100,000,000+) in revenue over the next 5 years to sustain and grow their own communities. Rethinking how we start these teams is a key to the success of this concept. I want to build these teams. 

# Summary of Concept

1. Immersive 90 day cohorts focused on Robotics and Manufacturing with foundational skills in Mathematics and Machine Learning.

2. Specilized training for rural communities, veterans and non-traditional students.

3. Provide Applied Engineering experience in Agriculture, Manufacturing, Construction and Earthworks with real-world projects and SBIR grants.

4. Projects are based on dual use technologies that can be used for both civilian and military applications to align better with DOE and DOD funding.

# Outcome: Technology Accelerator

The outcome of each class are teams that can execute on R&D projects and SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grants in partnership with aceademia and research institutions. Addtionally it seeks to inspire individuals who would not have otherwise pursue advanced degrees in Engineering and Mathematics. Some of these teams will start lasting companies.

Thank you for your time and consideration hopefully we can link up at some point soon.

Here is a summary of my current design for one cohort over 90 days.

I am looking for any support or partnerships that can help me fill in the gaps listed here. 

## Target Segment

Each class is 90 days of intensive hands on learning and project based work. All ages and skill levels are welcome. Each student will be assigned a mentor and small team of 5. Each class will have 5 teams of 5 for 25 students per cohort. 90 days of hands on immersion is key, I see no other way to overcome initial barriers to entry. Just like learning a new language, one has to live it to learn it.

4. 

reasoning
1. There is a nation wide shortage of skilled Engineers that have a deep understanding of mathematics. My recent experience indicates that new graduates and technitians now know less about math that even just a few years ago.

2. Students struggles with Math is one of the top reasons I hear for dropping out of school and pursuing more advanced degrees. 

3. Mathematics is the key skill that seperates top research labs and entrepurnieral teams

4. Many of my co-workers and Engieers have told me I should go teach at a school of my own after inspiring them to study and overcome their fear of Math. 

Part two is to find partners in education and research to submit SBIR and STTR to the NSF, DOD, DOE and
